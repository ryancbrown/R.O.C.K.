# POC ROCK 

POC ROCK is an app designed to connect NYC local margnalized artists with their audience. It allows artists to upload their profile to a database for event organizers to find/hire them, create and share an announcement about their events, and for audience members to find a list of local events. It is meant to boost POC, gender nonconfirming, and LGBTQ artists.

By using the api we created, other apps and websites can reference our event lists.
